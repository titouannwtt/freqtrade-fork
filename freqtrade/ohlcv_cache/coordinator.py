"""
In-flight request coalescing.

When two bots (or two tasks in the same bot) request overlapping gaps for
the same series, only one fetch goes out; the others `await` the shared
future.

Keys are aligned-timestamp ranges, so concurrent requests that differ by a
few seconds still coalesce as long as they want the same candles.
